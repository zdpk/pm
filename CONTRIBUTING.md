## Getting Started

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zdpk/project-manager.git
cd project-manager

# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build development version
make build-dev

# Test with development binary
./target/debug/_pm --help
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development mode (with extra features)
make run-dev -- <command>    # Run development binary
make build-dev               # Build development binary

# Production mode
make run-prod -- <command>   # Run production binary  
make build-prod              # Build production binary

# Testing and quality
make test                    # Run all tests
cargo fmt                    # Format code
cargo clippy                 # Lint code
```

## Contributing to Core PM

### Code Style
- Follow Rust conventions and `rustfmt` formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Write tests for new functionality
- Document public APIs with rustdoc

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Ensure all tests pass (`cargo test`)
6. Format code (`cargo fmt`)
7. Lint code (`cargo clippy`)
8. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
9. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
10. Open a Pull Request

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for new commands
- Test on multiple platforms when possible
- Include edge cases and error conditions

## Extension Development

### Quick Start

See the [Extension Development Guide](docs/EXTENSION_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive documentation.

#### 1. Create Extension Structure
```bash
mkdir pm-ext-myextension
cd pm-ext-myextension

# Create manifest
cat > manifest.yml << EOF
name: myextension
version: "1.0.0"
description: "My awesome PM extension"
author: "Your Name"
homepage: "https://github.com/username/pm-ext-myextension"
commands:
  - name: "start"
    help: "Start the service"
  - name: "stop"
    help: "Stop the service"
EOF
```

#### 2. Implement Binary (Any Language)

**Rust Example:**
```rust
use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};

#[derive(Parser)]
struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Commands,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Commands {
    #[command(hide = true)]
    PmInfo,
    Start,
    Stop,
}

fn main() {
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    
    match cli.command {
        Commands::PmInfo => {
            println!(r#"{{"name": "myextension", "version": "1.0.0"}}"#);
        },
        Commands::Start => {
            println!("Starting service...");
        },
        Commands::Stop => {
            println!("Stopping service...");
        },
    }
}
```

**Shell Script Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
case "$1" in
    "--pm-info")
        echo '{"name": "myextension", "version": "1.0.0"}'
        ;;
    "start")
        echo "Starting service..."
        ;;
    "stop")
        echo "Stopping service..."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: pm myextension <start|stop>"
        ;;
esac
```

#### 3. Test Locally
```bash
# Copy to extension directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/pm/extension/myextension
cp binary ~/.config/pm/extension/myextension/
cp manifest.yml ~/.config/pm/extension/myextension/
chmod +x ~/.config/pm/extension/myextension/binary

# Test with PM
pm ext list
pm ext info myextension
pm myextension start
```

### Extension Guidelines

#### Best Practices
- Keep extensions focused and lightweight
- Provide clear error messages
- Follow Unix philosophy (do one thing well)
- Use semantic versioning
- Include comprehensive help text
- Handle edge cases gracefully

#### Naming Conventions
- Repository: `pm-ext-{name}` (e.g., `pm-ext-docker`)
- Extension name: lowercase, no prefixes (e.g., `docker`, not `pm-docker`)
- Commands: descriptive, consistent with common tools
- Use established conventions where possible

#### Testing Extensions
```bash
# Manual testing
pm ext info myextension
pm myextension --help
pm myextension start
pm myextension stop

# Test error cases
pm myextension invalid-command
pm myextension start extra-args

# Test in different environments
PM_CURRENT_PROJECT='{}' pm myextension start
```
