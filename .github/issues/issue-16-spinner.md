# [FEATURE] Add animated spinners for background operations

## Feature Description
Implement animated spinners and status indicators for operations where progress cannot be easily quantified, providing visual feedback that the application is actively working.

## Use Case
- Show activity during git operations and network requests
- Provide feedback for file system operations with unknown duration
- Indicate background processing and validation tasks
- Maintain user engagement during wait periods

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement spinner system with various animations:
  - [ ] Multiple spinner styles (dots, bars, arrows, custom chars)
  - [ ] Configurable animation speed and patterns
  - [ ] Context-appropriate spinner selection
  - [ ] Smooth transitions between different states
- [ ] Add spinners for specific operations:
  - [ ] Git repository analysis and clone operations
  - [ ] Configuration file validation and processing
  - [ ] Project metadata collection and analysis
  - [ ] Background cache updates and maintenance
- [ ] Create smart spinner management:
  - [ ] Automatic spinner selection based on operation type
  - [ ] Graceful handling of terminal resize and interruption
  - [ ] Integration with logging and error reporting
  - [ ] Proper cleanup on operation completion or failure
- [ ] Add status messages with spinners:
  - [ ] Dynamic status text updates during operations
  - [ ] Operation completion summaries
  - [ ] Error state indicators and recovery suggestions

## Implementation Notes
- Use indicatif crate's spinner functionality
- Create src/ui/spinner.rs module
- Integrate with async operations and error handling
- Ensure spinners don't interfere with other output
- Add configuration options for spinner preferences
