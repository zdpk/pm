# [DOCS] Create comprehensive architecture and developer documentation

## Feature Description
Develop detailed technical documentation that explains the codebase architecture, design decisions, and development practices to facilitate contributions and maintenance.

## Use Case
- Help new contributors understand the codebase structure
- Document design decisions and architectural patterns
- Provide guidance for extending and modifying the application
- Establish development standards and best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create architecture overview documentation:
  - [ ] High-level system architecture and component relationships
  - [ ] Module organization and responsibility boundaries
  - [ ] Data flow and interaction patterns
  - [ ] Key abstractions and design patterns used
- [ ] Document code organization and conventions:
  - [ ] File and directory structure explanation
  - [ ] Naming conventions and coding standards
  - [ ] Error handling patterns and guidelines
  - [ ] Testing strategies and frameworks used
- [ ] Add developer guides and procedures:
  - [ ] Development environment setup instructions
  - [ ] Build and release process documentation
  - [ ] Contribution guidelines and pull request process
  - [ ] Code review standards and checklists
- [ ] Create technical reference materials:
  - [ ] Configuration schema documentation
  - [ ] API reference for internal modules
  - [ ] Performance characteristics and benchmarks
  - [ ] Security considerations and threat model

## Implementation Notes
- Create docs/ directory with structured documentation
- Use markdown format for consistency with GitHub
- Include diagrams for complex architectural concepts
- Reference existing ARCHITECTURE.md and expand significantly
- Ensure documentation stays current with code changes

## Related Issues
- Documents the architecture created by all previous implementations
- Enables future development and contributions
- Complements #18 (README) and #19 (CLI help) for complete documentation
