# [FEATURE] Add intelligent caching for project scan results

## Feature Description
Implement a smart caching system that stores and reuses project scan results to avoid redundant filesystem operations and improve application responsiveness.

## Use Case
- Cache frequently accessed project information
- Avoid re-scanning unchanged directories
- Provide instant results for repeated operations
- Reduce filesystem I/O for better performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design cache storage system:
  - [ ] File-based cache with configurable location
  - [ ] SQLite database for structured project metadata
  - [ ] Configurable cache size and TTL limits
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategies:
  - [ ] File modification time-based invalidation
  - [ ] Directory structure change detection
  - [ ] Manual cache refresh commands
  - [ ] Automatic background cache updates
- [ ] Add cache management features:
  - [ ] Cache statistics and health monitoring
  - [ ] Cache cleanup and optimization
  - [ ] Selective cache invalidation by path or pattern
- [ ] Ensure cache consistency across concurrent operations
- [ ] Add cache warming strategies for common access patterns
- [ ] Include cache performance metrics and monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- Create src/cache/ module with database abstraction
- Use existing uuid and chrono dependencies for cache keys
- Integrate with #09 (parallel scanning) for cache population
- Add cache configuration options to main config file
- Implement cache versioning for schema changes

## Related Issues
- Builds on #09 (parallel scanning)
- Significantly improves repeated operation performance
