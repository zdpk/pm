# [FEATURE] Optimize memory usage for large project collections

## Feature Description
Implement memory-efficient data structures and processing patterns to handle large numbers of projects without excessive RAM consumption.

## Use Case
- Support users with hundreds or thousands of projects
- Reduce memory footprint on resource-constrained systems
- Enable streaming processing for large datasets
- Improve application stability under memory pressure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement memory-efficient data structures:
  - [ ] Lazy loading for project metadata
  - [ ] Streaming iterators for large result sets
  - [ ] Reference-counted shared data for common fields
  - [ ] Compact serialization formats for cached data
- [ ] Add memory monitoring and limits:
  - [ ] Track memory usage during operations
  - [ ] Implement backpressure for memory-intensive operations
  - [ ] Add configurable memory usage limits
  - [ ] Graceful degradation when approaching limits
- [ ] Optimize string handling and allocations:
  - [ ] Use string interning for repeated values
  - [ ] Implement copy-on-write for project data
  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary string clones
- [ ] Add memory profiling and optimization tools:
  - [ ] Memory usage reporting commands
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks for memory efficiency
  - [ ] Integration tests with large datasets

## Implementation Notes
- Profile current memory usage patterns
- Use Rust's ownership system for zero-copy optimizations
- Consider using bytes crate for efficient string handling
- Implement memory pool patterns where beneficial
- Add memory usage metrics to telemetry
