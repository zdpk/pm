# Migration Guide: New Two-Step Tag Selection Interface

This guide helps existing PM users understand and adapt to the improved tag selection interface introduced in version 0.1.1.

## What Changed?

### Before (v0.1.0 and earlier)
PM used a single-step text-based interface with confusing elements:

```bash
$ pm add ./project

üè∑Ô∏è  Tags: _____ 
Type tag name to search/create, space for multiple, Enter to confirm

# Text input with various modes:
üè∑Ô∏è  Tags: rust backend api    # Direct input
üè∑Ô∏è  Tags: front typ          # Fuzzy matching  
üè∑Ô∏è  Tags:                    # Browse mode (empty input)
```

**Problems with the old interface:**
- ‚ùå Confusing mixed functionality in single input
- ‚ùå Unclear when you're creating vs. selecting tags
- ‚ùå No visual feedback during tag selection
- ‚ùå Difficult to browse existing tags
- ‚ùå No clear way to skip tags entirely

### After (v0.1.1+)
PM now uses a clean two-step approach:

```bash
$ pm add ./project

? What would you like to do?
  > Create Project [project] (without tags)
    Add tags to this project
    Create new tag and add to project

# Then conditional second step based on choice
```

**Benefits of the new interface:**
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between actions and tag selection
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback with checkboxes and tag counts
- ‚úÖ Real-time filtering with clear instructions
- ‚úÖ Flexible workflow supporting all use cases
- ‚úÖ No confusion about what each step does

## Migration Impact

### For Existing Users

**Good News**: No configuration changes needed! Your existing projects and tags continue to work exactly as before.

**What You'll Notice:**
1. **Different prompts**: The interface looks different but provides the same functionality
2. **Better workflow**: You can accomplish the same tasks more intuitively
3. **Enhanced features**: New filtering and browsing capabilities
4. **No data loss**: All your projects, tags, and settings are preserved

### Automatic Migrations

When you first run PM v0.1.1+, the following automatic migrations occur:

#### 1. Configuration Path Unification

PM now uses a unified directory approach for configuration files:

```bash
# New unified structure (v0.1.1+)
~/.config/pm/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yml          # Production configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config-dev.yml       # Development configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.schema.json   # JSON schema
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pm.zsh              # Shell integration files
```

**No manual migration needed** - PM automatically detects and uses the correct configuration file based on the mode (production vs development).

For more details, see [CONFIG_PATHS.md](CONFIG_PATHS.md).

#### 2. Git Repository Detection
```bash
# Old projects missing Git status get updated:
‚úÖ Migrating project configurations...
   Updated 15 projects with Git repository status
   Config saved with new format
```

Your projects now include Git repository status indicators:
- üìÅ Git repositories  
- ‚ùå Regular directories

#### 3. Version Update
Your config.yml is automatically updated:
```yaml
# Before
version: "1.0"

# After  
version: "0.1.1"
```

## Workflow Adaptations

### Old Workflow ‚Üí New Workflow

#### Creating Projects Without Tags
```bash
# Old way (unclear intent)
$ pm add ./project
üè∑Ô∏è  Tags: [press Enter twice]

# New way (explicit choice)
$ pm add ./project
? What would you like to do?
  > Create Project [project] (without tags)
```

#### Adding Existing Tags
```bash
# Old way (browse mode)
$ pm add ./project  
üè∑Ô∏è  Tags: [press Enter]
Select from existing tags:
[ ] rust (15 projects)
[x] backend (18 projects)

# New way (clearer workflow)
$ pm add ./project
? What would you like to do?
  > Add tags to this project

üè∑Ô∏è Select tags for this project (type to filter):
  [x] backend (18 projects)
```

#### Creating New Tags
```bash
# Old way (text input)
$ pm add ./project
üè∑Ô∏è  Tags: new-tag another-tag

# New way (guided creation)
$ pm add ./project
? What would you like to do?
  > Create new tag and add to project

‚ú® Create new tag: new-tag
? Add another new tag? Yes
‚ú® Create new tag: another-tag
? Add another new tag? No
```

#### Mixed Tag Creation + Selection
```bash
# Old way (complex text input)
$ pm add ./project
üè∑Ô∏è  Tags: new-tag existing
üìã Found matching: existing ‚Üí existing (5 projects)
‚ú® New: new-tag

# New way (step-by-step)
$ pm add ./project
? What would you like to do?
  > Create new tag and add to project

‚ú® Create new tag: new-tag
? Add another new tag? No
? Add existing tags as well? Yes
üè∑Ô∏è Select tags: [x] existing (5 projects)
```

## Learning the New Interface

### Quick Start Tips

1. **For quick projects**: Always choose "Create Project [name] (without tags)"
2. **For categorized projects**: Use "Add tags to this project" with filtering
3. **For new categories**: Use "Create new tag and add to project"
4. **When exploring**: Type in the filter to discover existing tags

### Common Workflows

#### Scenario: Frontend Developer
```bash
# Adding a React component library
$ pm add ./ui-components

? What would you like to do?
  > Add tags to this project

üè∑Ô∏è Select tags for this project (type to filter): react
  [x] react (5 projects)
  
# Type "comp" to find component-related tags:
üè∑Ô∏è Select tags for this project (type to filter): comp
  [x] react (5 projects)
  [x] components (2 projects)
```

#### Scenario: Backend Developer  
```bash
# Adding a new microservice
$ pm add ./user-service

? What would you like to do?
  > Create new tag and add to project

‚ú® Create new tag: microservice
? Add another new tag? No
? Add existing tags as well? Yes

üè∑Ô∏è Select tags for this project (type to filter): back
  [x] backend (8 projects)
  [x] api (4 projects)
```

### Advanced Features

#### Smart Filtering
The new interface provides powerful filtering:

```bash
# Filter by technology:
üè∑Ô∏è Select tags (type to filter): python
  [ ] python (8 projects)
  [ ] python-flask (2 projects)

# Filter by project type:
üè∑Ô∏è Select tags (type to filter): api
  [ ] api (5 projects)
  [ ] rest-api (2 projects)
  [ ] graphql-api (1 projects)

# Filter by client:
üè∑Ô∏è Select tags (type to filter): client
  [ ] client-acme (3 projects)
  [ ] client-beta (2 projects)
```

## Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Issue: Interface Looks Different
**Solution**: This is expected! The new interface is intentionally different to be clearer.

### Issue: Can't Find My Existing Tags
**Solution**: Choose "Add tags to this project" then type to filter and find your tags.

### Issue: Want to Skip Tag Selection Quickly
**Solution**: Always choose "Create Project [name] (without tags)" as the first option.

### Issue: Miss the Old Text Input
**Solution**: The new interface is more powerful. Use filtering to achieve the same speed:
- Type "rust" to find all Rust-related tags
- Type "client" to find all client tags
- Type "api" to find all API-related tags

### Issue: Don't See Git Status Icons
**Solution**: This is a new feature. Your projects now show:
- üìÅ for Git repositories
- ‚ùå for regular directories

## Performance Improvements

The new interface also brings performance benefits:

### Faster Tag Discovery
- **Real-time filtering** instead of text parsing
- **Visual feedback** with usage counts
- **Smart suggestions** based on existing taxonomy

### Better Error Prevention
- **Clear workflow steps** prevent confusion
- **Visual confirmation** before creating tags
- **Duplicate prevention** built-in

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Consistent behavior** across all scenarios
- **Clear help text** at each step
- **Cancellation support** with Ctrl+C

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I still use `pm add *` for batch operations?**
A: Yes! Batch operations skip the interactive tag selection for efficiency. Add tags afterward with `pm tag add project-name tag1 tag2`.

**Q: Will my existing tags and projects work?**
A: Absolutely! All existing data is preserved and enhanced with new features.

**Q: Can I go back to the old interface?**
A: The old interface is deprecated in favor of the improved experience. The new interface provides all the same functionality with better usability.

**Q: How do I update my muscle memory?**
A: Practice the new workflows a few times. Most users find the new interface more intuitive within a day or two.
